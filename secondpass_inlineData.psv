4515-31871|A negationInd of "true" coupled with an observation/value/@code of SNOMED code 64572001 "Disease (disorder)" indicates that the patient has no known conditions.
4515-33034|The effectiveTime represents the relevant time of the observation. A patient's "gender identity" may change and using effectiveTime/low and effectiveTime/high defines the time during which the patient had identified as specified.
4515-15604|The effectiveTime/high (a.k.a. "resolution date") asserts when the condition became clinically resolved.
4515-15603|The effectiveTime/low (a.k.a. "onset date") asserts when the condition became clinically active.
4515-31870|The observation/value and all the qualifiers together (often referred to as a post-coordinated expression) make up one concept. Qualifiers constrain the meaning of the primary code, and cannot negate it or change its meaning. Qualifiers can only be used according to well-defined rules of post-coordination and only if the underlying code system defines the use of such qualifiers or if there is a third code system that specifies how other code systems may be combined.*N-ENDLINE**N-ENDLINE*For example, SNOMED CT allows constructing concepts as a combination of multiple codes. SNOMED CT defines a concept "pneumonia (disorder)" (233604007) an attribute "finding site" (363698007) and another concept "left lower lobe of lung (body structure)" (41224006). In this example the observation value would contain "pneumonia (disorder)" (233604007), the qualifier name would contain "finding site" (363698007), and the qualifier value would contain "left lower lobe of lung (body structure)" (41224006).

4515-32884|The effectiveTime represents the relevant time of the observation. A patient's "sexual orientation" may change and using effectiveTime/low and effectiveTime/high defines the time during which the patient had identified their emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectional attraction to another person.

1198-14836|A serviceEvent represents the main act being documented, such as a colonoscopy or a cardiac stress study. In a provision of healthcare serviceEvent, the care providers, PCP, or other longitudinal providers, are recorded within the serviceEvent. If the document is about a single encounter, the providers associated can be recorded in the componentOf/encompassingEncounter template.
1198-8333|A special class of participant is the supporting person or organization:  an individual or an organization that has a relationship to the patient, including  parents, relatives, caregivers, insurance policyholders, and guarantors. In the case of a supporting person who is also an emergency contact or next-of-kin, a participant element should be present for each role recorded.
1198-31086|Heading: nonXMLBody*R-ENDLINE**N-ENDLINE*An Unstructured Document must include a nonXMLBody component with a single text element. The text element can reference an external file using a reference element, or include unstructured content directly with a mediaType attribute. The nonXMLBody/text element also has a "compression" attribute that can be used to indicate that the unstructured content was compressed before being Base64Encoded. At a minimum, a compression value of "DF" for the deflate compression algorithm (RFC 1951 [URL:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt]) must be supported although it is not required that content be compressed.

1198-30940|The id element of the encompassingEncounter represents the identifier for the encounter. When the diagnostic imaging procedure is performed in the context of a hospital stay or an outpatient visit for which there is an Encounter Number, that number should be present as the ID of the encompassingEncounter.*R-ENDLINE**N-ENDLINE*The effectiveTime represents the time interval or point in time in which the encounter took place. The encompassing encounter might be that of the hospital or office visit in which the diagnostic imaging procedure was performed. If the effective time is unknown, a nullFlavor attribute can be used.
1198-8480|The main activity being described by a CCD is the provision of healthcare over a period of time. This is shown by setting the value of serviceEvent/@classCode to "PCPR" (care provision) and indicating the duration over which care was provided in serviceEvent/effectiveTime. Additional data from outside this duration may also be included if it is relevant to care provided during that time range (e.g., reviewed during the stated time range). *R-ENDLINE**N-ENDLINE*NOTE: Implementations originating a CCD should take care to discover what the episode of care being summarized is. For example, when a patient fills out a form providing relevant health history, the episode of care being documented might be from birth to the present.
