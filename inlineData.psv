Within each documentationOf element, there is one serviceEvent element. This event is the unit imaging procedure corresponding to a billable item. The type of imaging procedure may be further described in the serviceEvent/code element. This guide makes no specific recommendations about the vocabulary to use for describing this event. In IHE Scheduled Workflow environments, one serviceEvent/id element contains the DICOM Study Instance UID from the Modality Worklist, and the second serviceEvent/id element contains the DICOM Requested Procedure ID from the Modality Worklist. These two ids are in a single serviceEvent. The effectiveTime for the serviceEvent covers the duration of the imaging procedure being reported.

This optionality reflects two major approaches to the grouping of procedures as implemented in the installed base of imaging information systems. These approaches differ in their handling of grouped procedures and how they are mapped to identifiers in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image and structured reporting data. The example of a CT examination covering chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be used in the discussion below. In the IHE Scheduled Workflow model, the Chest CT, Abdomen CT, and Pelvis CT each represent a Requested Procedure, and all three procedures are grouped under a single Filler Order. The Filler Order number maps directly to the DICOM Accession Number in the DICOM imaging and report data. A widely deployed alternative approach maps the requested procedure identifiers directly to the DICOM Accession Number. The Requested Procedure ID in such implementations may or may not be different from the Accession Number, but is of little identifying importance because there is only one Requested Procedure per Accession Number.
